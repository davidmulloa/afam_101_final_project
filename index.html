        <p class="note">The exhibit uses W. E. B. Du Bois’s idea of double consciousness as its lens. Each room pairs artworks with readings that explain how race is made, circulated, and resisted. The goal is not summary. The goal is to practice method: how to read pictures, headlines, and symbols without letting them hide the structures that produced them.</p>

        <h2>Inventing Race, Erasing Voices</h2>
        <p class="lede">Michael Omi and Howard Winant argue that race is not a stable essence or biological fact, but an ongoing social project that is constantly produced and revised through political decisions, institutional practices, and cultural representation. Laws and policies help define who belongs and who is excluded, but images and stories are just as powerful in shaping racial meaning. Visual culture teaches people how to see race, what to expect from it, and what roles feel natural or inevitable. In this room, images are treated as active participants in racial formation rather than neutral reflections of the past. They organize attention, assign value, and normalize hierarchy. By placing these works alongside historical texts, the exhibit shows how race is made visible, persuasive, and durable, even as it appears to be common sense.</p>

            Aaron Douglas’s Aspects of Negro Life visualizes the central tension of double consciousness by placing Black history within a single, shared field where past and future coexist. The silhouetted figures move from enslavement and forced labor toward education, music, and collective political life, suggesting both the weight of historical constraint and the possibility of self-directed progress. Douglas does not isolate suffering as a completed past; instead, he layers it into the background that shapes Black modernity. Read through Omi and Winant’s theory of racial formation, the mural shows how race is produced through institutions, labor systems, and state power rather than individual identity alone. At the same time, Douglas reclaims visual authority by centering Black cultural expression as a force of historical agency. In the context of this exhibit, the mural models what it means to “see otherwise”: to recognize how domination structures the background of social life while still imagining futures that are not determined by it.</figcaption>

The circles, the cropped bodies, and the layered silhouettes perform exactly what Omi and Winant describe: the constant negotiation over the meaning of bodies in public space. Double consciousness belongs here because it gives a name to the cost of appearing through someone else’s terms while designing a way to appear on one’s own terms at the same time. The viewer is asked to train a split attention. One eye tracks how power scripts identity. The other eye rehearses ways that people redirect those scripts.</p>

        <h2>“Ain’t I a Woman?” Speaking Back</h2>
        <p class="lede">Sojourner Truth forces the category of woman to meet the lives of Black women. Patricia Hill Collins explains why this force was necessary. The public relied on controlling images to make exploitation appear like nature. Art in this room stages refusals of that economy.
          <br>
          <br>
          Read through Du Bois’s double consciousness, these controlling images reveal how Black women were required to understand themselves through a gaze that denied their vulnerability while demanding their labor. Truth’s question “Ain’t I a woman?” exposes that split by making visible the contradiction between  ideals and lived experience. Collins names the mechanism that sustains that contradiction, showing how images such as Mammy or Jezebel function as tools of social control rather than descriptions of reality. The works in this room refuse those scripts by insisting on specificity, interiority, and historical context. In doing so, they demonstrate the exhibit’s method: to see how categories are built to exclude, and how reclaiming vision becomes a form of resistance rather than representation alone.

          <figcaption>Elizabeth Catlett, <em>The Sharecropper</em>. The carved lines mark years of heat, weight, and skill. The face is not flat. It is specific. This specificity is an ethical claim. The portrait refuses the reduction that controlling images demand.

          <br>
          <br>
          Read through Du Bois’s lens of double consciousness, The Sharecropper exposes the distance between how Black labor has been seen and how it has been lived. The figure carries the historical weight of agricultural exploitation, yet Catlett refuses to let that history collapse into stereotype or invisibility. This resistance echoes Sojourner Truth’s insistence on self-definition and Ida B. Wells’s demand that Black life be understood through evidence rather than myth. In contrast to the silences Trouillot identifies in historical production, Catlett makes presence undeniable. The portrait insists that Black labor and dignity cannot be reduced to background or symbol. Within this exhibit, Catlett’s work demonstrates how reclaiming visual specificity becomes a method of seeing otherwise, one that challenges both erasure and distortion across history.

      <div class="panel prose wide">
        <p>Truth’s speech inventories labor, grief, and thought. The inventory matters because it supplies a record that the official category left out. Collins names the system that produced that absence. Mammy, jezebel, and sapphire were not stray insults. They were tools that guided policy, work assignments, and the policing of behavior. When Catlett insists on texture and when Walker forces us to stare at flatness, the works demonstrate two solutions to the same problem. One insists on depth. The other exposes the technology of flattening. Double consciousness is the practice that holds both solutions at once. It keeps a person legible to those who demand a script while composing a counter-image that answers the demand with precision.</p>

        <h2>Ida B. Wells: Turning the Gaze Around</h2>
        <p class="lede">Wells reads newspapers the way a conservator reads a canvas. She looks for seams and inconsistencies. She compares headlines to court documents and witness accounts. She publishes tables and cases so that the reader can follow the reasoning. The work is visual and forensic.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Read through Du Bois’s double consciousness, Wells’s method exposes the split between what the nation claimed to see and what Black communities were forced to know. White newspapers circulated stories that preserved a moral self-image, while Black readers lived with the material consequences of those lies. Wells refuses that split by turning the gaze back onto the storytellers themselves. Trouillot helps clarify why this move mattered: power shapes history not only through violence, but through control over narration and interpretation. By making her sources visible and her logic traceable, Wells interrupts the production of silence. In this exhibit, her work models how seeing otherwise requires discipline, patience, and the willingness to question stories that feel too smooth to be true.

          <p>Southern Horrors does three things that inform the whole exhibit. It teaches the reader to distrust stories that travel too easily. It models a step-by-step comparison between myth and evidence. It names the pattern that links individual cases to a social order. When we place Gordon Parks’s American Gothic beside Wells, the photograph becomes a thesis about national symbols. The flag remains in the frame. The person at the center changes. The broom and the mop refuse abstraction. The image asks the viewer to reconcile patriotic self-concepts with the labor that holds the building together.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Wells’s method also clarifies how power controls what counts as “history,” which is where Trouillot’s framework sharpens the room’s argument. Trouillot shows that silences enter history through what gets recorded, archived, and narrated, meaning violence can be publicly visible and still be socially misnamed or minimized. Read through Du Bois’s double consciousness, that produces a split reality: Black communities know the truth of racial terror while the nation protects its self-image by repeating cleaner stories. Parks stages that split in a single frame. The flag represents the official story, while the tools and posture represent the lived one. Together, Wells and Parks train the exhibit’s central practice: to read symbols, headlines, and images as arguments about belonging, and to refuse the comfort of narratives that make injustice look natural or deserved.</p>

        <h2>From Jim Crow to the New Jim Crow</h2>
        <p class="lede">The claim that policy is neutral often hides older structures in new forms. Du Bois gives us a vocabulary of sight. The background is not empty. It is designed. Glenn Ligon and Rashid Johnson give that vocabulary a surface that can be studied.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Michelle Alexander shows how the language of neutrality allows racial hierarchy to persist without naming itself. Criminality replaces race as the visible marker, while policies and practices quietly reproduce exclusion. Read through Du Bois’s double consciousness, this produces a familiar split: a society that insists it does not see race, and communities that live with its effects daily. Ligon and Johnson make that contradiction legible. Ligon turns a passing remark into a dense field that reveals how repetition manufactures common sense. Johnson records the inward pressure of being constantly readable under that field. Together, these works teach the exhibit’s method for this moment in history: to study the background as a structure, to recognize how vision is trained by power, and to see how old systems survive by learning how not to look like themselves.
      </div>

      <div class="grid two">
        <figure class="art shadow">

          <figcaption>Glenn Ligon, <em>Untitled (I Feel Most Colored…)</em>. The repeated sentence becomes a dark field that presses against the paper’s white edge. A remark becomes a medium. The work literalizes Du Bois’s insight about a sharp background and turns it into something you can point to and measure.</figcaption>
          <br>
          <br>
          Glenn Ligon’s work also clarifies how racial meaning is manufactured through repetition, which is exactly what Omi and Winant describe as racial formation operating across culture as well as law. The sentence does not stay a sentence. It accumulates into atmosphere, teaching the viewer how “common sense” about race is built through familiar phrases that circulate until they feel natural. That is why the piece fits this exhibit’s method: it trains you to read the background as an active force rather than empty space. In Trouillot’s terms, what gets repeated can become the official story, while what is not repeated becomes silent. Ligon reverses that process by making repetition visible and heavy. Under Du Bois’s lens of double consciousness, the field becomes a record of living under constant interpretation, where the self is shaped by a white edge that never disappears even when it is not explicitly named.

          <figcaption>Rashid Johnson, <em>Anxious Men</em>. Thick lines scratch a mask into being. The portrait looks quick but it carries layers of wax, soap, and black soap pigment. The surface records a body that has learned to anticipate a gaze.</figcaption>

          <blockquote class="quote">“Black women’s experiences and ideas have been routinely distorted, misrepresented, or silenced.” — Patricia Hill Collins, Black Feminist Thoughts</em></blockquote>
          <br>
          <br>
          Read through Du Bois’s double consciousness, Rashid Johnson’s Anxious Men becomes a portrait of what it feels like to live under the veil, where the self is always negotiating how it will be read from the outside. The layered materials and scratched lines do not just create texture, they stage a struggle over legibility, as if the face is being built and defended at the same time. That struggle connects to Omi and Winant’s racial formation because the “gaze” Johnson anticipates is not merely personal prejudice, it is a social system that trains audiences to see Blackness through scripted meanings. It also echoes Collins’s argument about controlling images, which pressure Black subjects into roles that appear natural but are politically useful. In this exhibit’s method, the surface becomes evidence: like Wells’s documentation and Trouillot’s attention to silences, Johnson shows that what looks abstract or private is often an archive of public power. The portrait records not only anxiety, but the constant labor of managing visibility in a world that claims neutrality while demanding Black bodies remain readable on unequal terms.

      <div class="panel prose">
        <p>Read these with the New Jim Crow argument in mind. When a system claims to be colorblind, we should ask where the color travels instead. It travels into the design of neighborhoods, the distribution of risk, and the probability of police contact. Du Bois helps us phrase this as a problem of sight. Wells helps us test it with evidence. Ligon and Johnson help us map it on the surface. The goal is a cycle of reading. Look for the background. Gather the record. Study the feeling that confirms what the record shows. Turn the study into public language that can change policy.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          Read through Du Bois’s double consciousness, Kehinde Wiley’s Equestrian Portrait exposes how power is learned visually, long before it is argued politically. The scale, posture, and ornament come from a tradition that trained viewers to associate authority with whiteness and domination, a process Omi and Winant would describe as racial formation operating through culture rather than law alone. By inserting a Black subject without altering the visual language of power, Wiley refuses both erasure and assimilation. The work does not ask permission to belong. It assumes the right to define who can occupy the center of the frame. In Trouillot’s terms, Wiley interrupts the production of silence by forcing histories of exclusion to confront a presence they were never designed to accommodate. Within this exhibit’s method, the portrait shows how reclaiming vision is not symbolic alone, but structural. Changing who fills the frame changes what the frame means.

      <div class="panel prose">
        <p>My goal in this project was to treat sight as a method rather than a metaphor. I chose the digital museum format, room-by-room pacing, and artwork captions to make the analysis feel like moving through curated evidence rather than reading a standard essay. Du Bois’s account of double consciousness provided a through-line for reading images as arguments about who belongs at the center of the frame and on what terms. Beginning with racial formation clarifies that race is built and maintained across policies, headlines, and habits. That frame shaped how I looked at Aaron Douglas’s murals: they do not simply illustrate a linear history of Black life. They model a redesigned public where music, speech, and assembly share the field with institutions that once excluded them. The room on Sojourner Truth and Patricia Hill Collins extended this approach to gender. Truth’s inventory of labor and loss is not a single dramatic line. It is evidence that the category “woman” required Black women’s work while denying their personhood. Collins names the system as controlling images that made such denial appear natural. Placing Catlett’s carved specificity beside Walker’s weaponized flatness tests two ways of refusing stereotype: one restores depth, the other exposes the machine that produces flatness.</p>
        <p>Ida B. Wells taught me to read like a researcher. Her method of comparing rumor to record matched well with Gordon Parks’s reworking of American iconography. Together they sharpened my sense that images participate in making public common sense. That insight prepared me to think about the carceral state with more precision: if a system claims neutrality, the background becomes the object of study. Ligon’s fields of text make the background literal, and Johnson’s surfaces register the inward pressure that such a background creates. These works kept the analysis honest by tying policy talk to sensation and trace.</p>
        <p>The final room was an experiment in authorship. Edmonia Lewis and Kehinde Wiley use materials and scales that have historically carried authority. Their works are not decorative reversals. They are proposals for a different rule of representation—one in which Black presence sets the measure of the frame. Across the project I learned that double consciousness can be a craft as well as a wound. The craft consists of three moves: identify how the picture was made, refuse its false neutrality with specific evidence, and then compose a new picture that holds more of the truth. This sequence maps to the course outcomes: applying key concepts to visual and textual sources, tracking turning points in cultural history, and showing how past forms persist in the present. It also guided choices about presentation—museum pacing, figure captions, and quote boxes—to keep the analysis accessible without flattening complexity.</p>
